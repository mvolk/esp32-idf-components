# ESP32 ESP-IDF Prototyping Components

This repository draws together a variety of components for the ESP-IDF
development platform and ESP32 MCU. Each of these components lives
independently in its own repository, and it is from those repositories
that you should clone these components into your project(s).

This repository offers examples, intra-component integration tests, and
a central location for browsing the complete collection of ESP32
components I have to offer.
